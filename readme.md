## Objective

Post-pandemic, and with rising fuel prices, the aviation market has seen significant price volatility. As an aviation enthusiast, I wanted to understand what truly drives ticket prices in India.

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on flight ticket prices for India's top 6 metro areas to understand the key factors that influence pricing. The goal is to uncover patterns that can help travelers plan their bookings more efficiently.

## üìä Analysis Highlights

The analysis, conducted in the `India Airlines Ticket Price Exploratory Analysis.ipynb` notebook, answers several key questions:

* ‚úàÔ∏è **Airline Market Share:** Which airlines (Vistara, Air India, etc.) operate the most flights in this dataset?
* üí∞ **Price by Class:** How significant is the price difference between Economy and Business class?
* üìà **Price vs. Booking Time:** How does the price change as the departure date (`days_left`) approaches?
* ‚è≥ **Price vs. Flight Duration:** What is the relationship between flight duration and ticket cost?
* üó∫Ô∏è **Route Analysis:** How do prices vary based on source (`source_city`) and destination (`destination_city`)?
* ‚è∞ **Time of Day:** Are there cheaper times to depart or arrive (Morning, Evening, Night)?
* üõë **Stops vs. Price:** How do non-stop, one-stop, and multi-stop flights compare in price?

## üñ•Ô∏è Power BI Dashboard

A comprehensive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize the findings interactively. It allows users to filter by airline, class, source, and destination to get a clear, dynamic view of the pricing landscape.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* **Python:** For the core analysis.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For static data visualization in the notebook.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For iterative analysis and documentation.
* **Power BI:** For creating the interactive dashboard.

## üíæ Dataset

The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle** and was originally scraped from the "Ease My Trip" website.

* **Source:** [Kaggle Flight Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction)
* **Content:** Contains 300,261 flight booking records.
* **Features:** Includes `airline`, `flight`, `source_city`, `destination_city`, `class`, `departure_time`, `arrival_time`, `duration`, `stops`, `days_left`, and `price`.
* **Date Range:** Data was collected for 50 days, from February 11 to March 31, 2022.

## üí° Key Findings

1.  **Class is Key:** Business class (primarily offered by Vistara and Air India) is significantly more expensive than Economy. Vistara's business class is, on average, the most expensive.
2.  **Book in Advance:** Prices rise sharply within the last 20 days before departure. The "sweet spot" for booking appears to be 3-7 weeks in advance.
3.  **Cheapest Airline:** 'AirAsia' consistently offers the cheapest economy class tickets among the 6 airlines.
4.  **Stops Cost More:** Non-stop flights are generally the cheapest. Prices increase with one or more stops.
5.  **Timing Matters:** Flights departing late at night and arriving early in the morning tend to be cheaper.
6.  **Route Variations:** Delhi (due to high connectivity) appears to be one of the cheapest cities to fly from, while Hyderabad is one of the more expensive cities to fly *to*.
